Chi-squared test of independence: toss_result_match vs toss_decision

1. Aim of the analysis

The goal of this analysis was to test whether there is a statistical association between:

toss_result_match – whether the team that won the toss went on to win or lose the match

toss_decision – the decision made after winning the toss (e.g. bat vs field)

In other words, we wanted to know:

Does the toss decision (bat/field) have a relationship with the final match outcome for the team that won the toss, or are these two variables independent?


2. Data and contingency table

First, we created a contingency table using the two categorical variables:

table_decision <- table(df$toss_result_match, df$toss_decision)
table_decision


Each cell in table_decision counts how many matches fall into a given combination of:

row = outcome (toss_result_match)

column = toss decision (toss_decision)

Because both variables have two categories, this results in a 2×2 contingency table, which is a standard setting for applying a chi-squared test of independence.


3. Results and interpretation

From the output:

Test statistic: X² = 5.7825

Degrees of freedom: df = 1 (because this is a 2×2 table)

p-value = 0.01619

Using a conventional significance level of α = 0.05:

Because p = 0.01619 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of independence.

This means we found statistically significant evidence of an association between:

whether the team that won the toss wins the match (toss_result_match), and

the decision they make after winning the toss (toss_decision).
