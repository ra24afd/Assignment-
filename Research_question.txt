Research question we have chosen : Is there a difference in the proportion of match results between Coin toss winning teams that choose to bat and those that choose to field in the IPL Cricket Tournament between 2008 to 2017?


Independent variable: coin toss 
Variable datatype : Nominal 

Dependent variable: Match result
Variable datatype : Nominal 

Null hypothesis (H₀) :: There is no difference in the proportion of match results between Coin toss winning teams that choose to bat and those that choose to field in the IPL Cricket Tournament between 2008 to 2017

Alternative hypothesis (H₁) : There is difference in the proportion of match results between Coin toss winning teams that choose to bat and those that choose to field in the IPL Cricket Tournament between 2008 to 2017.

*****What we understood and why we chosen this *****

We chose this research question because the coin toss is an important strategic moment in cricket.
We wanted to see whether choosing to bat or field actually makes a difference in winning.
Both variables are nominal, so comparing proportions is meaningful and suitable.
The IPL has consistent data from 2008–2017, making analysis reliable.
Overall, this question helps us understand if toss decisions truly impact match outcomes.
